About Me
------
Hello, my name is Wenxuan Bao (包文轩). I am a Staff Research Scientist at Visa Research, where my work focuses on AI agents security, privacy and reliability. 

I earned my PhD from the CISE Department at the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) in December 2025. During my PhD, I was part of the Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research ([FICS](https://fics.institute.ufl.edu/)), advised by [Dr. Vincent Bindschaedler](https://vbinds.ch/).

Research Interests
------
Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning,  Differential Privacy, AI Agents Security, Privacy and Reliability.
